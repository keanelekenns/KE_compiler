This is a compiler for the unnamedLanguage (file extension .ul). The compiler is
implemented in Java, ANTLR 3 is used for parsing the grammar file (unnamedLanguage.g),
and Jasmin is used for generating a java class file. The compiler generates a .j file that 
must be run using jasmin.Main in order to obtain the final executable class file.

SETUP:

Windows - run "scripts\setup.bat" from the main directory (i.e. KE_Compiler).

Linux - run "make" from the main directory (i.e. KE_Compiler).

USAGE:

From the main directory, run "java Compiler <filename>.ul [-pp | -ir]".
This step generates <filename>.j in the location specified by the path to <filename>.ul.

To generate a class file, run "java jasmin.Main [-d path-to-destination] <filename>.j.
A suggested destination folder for class files generated from .ul files is the ulclasses directory.

Finally, to execute the program, run "java <filename>" ensuring the classfile is in the current classpath.

OPTIONS:

-pp : Prints a reformatted version of the input file to stdout. "PP" stands for "Pretty Print".

-ir : Prints the Intermediate Representation generated by the compiler to stdout.

DOCS:

The following documents are all found in the docs folder (found within the main directory).

"ULRefManual.pdf" - Information regarding syntax of the unnamedLanguage.
"TypeCheckingRules.pdf" - Information regarding the type checking rules.
"IRSpecification.pdf" - Rules and syntax regarding the Intermediate Representation.
"PPFormat.pdf" - Formatting specification for the -pp option.

TESTING:
 
Acceptance of programs by grammar:

Windows -
run "scripts\run_tests_a1.bat" from the main directory.
Linux - 
run "scripts/run_tests_a1.bash" from the main directory.
 
Note: the accept_tests may not be accepted by the type checker, this is because assignment 1 was simply for determining what gets past the grammar stage.


Detecting errors during type checking:

Windows -
run "scripts\run_tests_a2.bat" from the main directory.
Linux - 
run "scripts/run_tests_a2.bash" from the main directory.


Generating & executing code:

Windows -
run "scripts\run_tests_a4.bat" from the main directory.
Linux - 
run "scripts\run_tests_a4.bash" from the main directory.
